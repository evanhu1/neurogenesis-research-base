# Neurogenesis

<p><strong>Neuroevolution artificial-life simulation built in Rust</strong></p>

</div>

The goal of this project is to achieve open-ended evolution of cognition, from
basic sensory-motor reactions (see food ahead, move forward), to complex
intelligent behavior (internal states, memory, navigation, predation), by
evolving creatures in a 2D world.

The main challenge is creating an evolutionary curriculum that scales
environment complexity with cognitive evolution while avoiding convergence to
degenerate niches along the way.

In designing the brain we take a neuromorphic approach that implements many
structural (e.g. excitatory / inhibitory synapses) and algorithmic (e.g. Hebbian
plasticity) priors from biological brains, while taking advantage of silicon
hardware (e.g. floating point precision).

## Quickstart

Prerequisites: a recent Rust toolchain and Node.js with npm.

1. Verify the workspace: `cargo test --workspace`
2. Start the backend: `cargo run -p sim-server`
3. In another shell, install frontend dependencies (first run only):
   `cd web-client && npm install`
4. Start the frontend: `cd web-client && npm run dev`
5. Open `http://127.0.0.1:5173/`

## Evaluation Harness

Use `sim-evaluation` to benchmark the evolution loop and inspect whether
behavioral adaptation is emerging.

- Cargo command (release):
  - `cargo run -p sim-evaluation --release --`
- Make command:
  - `make evaluate`
- Baseline/random-action control:
  - `cargo run -p sim-evaluation --release -- --baseline`
- Faster smoke run:
  - `cargo run -p sim-evaluation --release -- --ticks 1000 --report-every 250`

By default the harness runs a fixed 10-seed benchmark suite. You can override it
with `--seed` and a comma-separated list such as `--seed 42,123,7`.

Each run writes artifacts under `artifacts/evaluation/...` including
`timeseries.csv`, `summary.json`, and `report.html`.

## Layout

- `sim-types/` — shared domain types used across all Rust crates.
- `sim-config/` — world/seed-genome configuration crate, TOML loader,
  validation, owned defaults/policies, and generated config reference.
- `sim-core/` — deterministic simulation engine:
  - `lib.rs` — `Simulation` struct, config validation.
  - `turn.rs` + `turn/` — tick orchestration split into lifecycle, snapshot,
    intents, move resolution, reproduction, and commit modules.
  - `brain.rs` + `brain/` — genome expression, sensing, and evaluation helpers.
  - `plasticity.rs` — runtime eligibility/coactivation and Hebbian updates.
  - `genome.rs` + `genome/` — seed generation, mutation-rate accessors, scalar
    mutation, topology mutation, spatial prior logic, and sanitization.
  - `spawn.rs` + `spawn/` — organism spawning, terrain generation, and food
    ecology/regrowth.
  - `topology.rs` — shared neuron/synapse topology helpers and invariants.
  - `grid.rs` — hex-grid geometry and occupancy helpers.
- `sim-evaluation/` — headless evaluation harness split into CLI, orchestration,
  aggregation, comparison, output, and report modules.
- `sim-server/` — Axum HTTP + WebSocket server. Server-only API types live in
  `src/protocol.rs`.
- `web-client/` — React + TailwindCSS + Vite canvas UI.
- `sim-config/config.toml` — baseline simulation configuration.
- `sim-config/CONFIG_REFERENCE.md` — generated config reference derived from the
  config source of truth.

## High level design

- Brain:
  - Each organism has a 3-layer neural circuit with sensory, inter, and action
    neurons.
  - Inter neurons are leaky integrators (`alpha` from log time constants) with
    tanh nonlinearity.
  - Synapse weights are initialized from a log-normal magnitude distribution,
    then updated by runtime plasticity and genome mutation operators.
  - Action policy is categorical sampling from softmax logits with configurable
    `action_temperature`; sampling is deterministic for fixed seed + turn +
    organism ID.
  - Runtime plasticity uses coactivation traces, dopamine from
    baseline-corrected energy delta, weight decay, and maturity-gated pruning.
- Environment:
  - Toroidal axial hex grid with static terrain walls generated from Perlin
    noise.
  - Food ecology uses a binary fertility map from Perlin noise; regrowth is
    event-driven per cell.
  - Occupancy is single-entity per cell (`Organism`, `Food`, or `Wall`).
- Algorithms:
  - Simulation advances in deterministic tick phases with stable tie-breaking.
  - Batch world runs are supported on the server and execute in parallel
    workers.
- Evolution:
  - Reproduction is asexual with per-operator mutation-rate genes and optional
    meta-mutation.
  - NEAT-style topology mutators are implemented: add synapse, remove synapse,
    and split-edge/add-neuron.
  - Spatial priors bias new synapse creation based on neuron positions.
  - The server maintains a persistent champion genome pool and bootstraps new
    sessions/batch worlds from it when available, instead of always starting
    from the primitive seed genome.
  - Periodic random injections add fresh seed-genome organisms.
- Ecology:
  - `Eat` consumes food only. Plants return `20%` of stored energy; corpses
    return `80%`.
  - `Attack` damages organisms only when split attack actions are enabled and
    spawns corpse food on lethal hits.
  - Passive metabolism scales with inter-neuron count, sensory count, synapse
    count, and vision distance.
  - Reproduction requires maturity and energy investment, then completes after a
    lock delay.

## Performance

`cargo bench -p sim-core --bench turn_throughput`

Performance regression guard tests (ignored by default):

`cargo test -p sim-core --release performance_regression -- --ignored --nocapture`

Optional CI budget override:

`SIM_CORE_TICK_BUDGET_NS_PER_TURN=130000 make perf-test`
